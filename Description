DESCRIPTION:-
In TensorFlow Playground, the tanh (hyperbolic tangent) activation function maps inputs to values between -1 and 1, 
making it useful for data centered around zero. Its smooth, S-shaped curve allows both positive and negative activations, 
helping the network learn complex, non-linear patterns. Compared to sigmoid, tanh offers faster convergence since it is 
zero-centered, though it can still suffer from vanishing gradients in deeper networks. While not as widely used as ReLU 
for deep architectures, tanh is effective in tasks like RNNs, where capturing both positive and negative dependencies 
is crucial. Experimenting with tanh in the Playground helps visualize how it shapes decision boundaries and impacts training dynamics.
